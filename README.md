higgsUtils - An Introduction to the Package
================

Initial setup
==================

To get started, simply check out the package from git, and run the following commands
(or put them in your `.bash_profile` script):

     export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/higgsUtils/python
     export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/higgsUtils/genericUtils/python
     export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/HggStarUtils/genericUtils/macros

(This appends the python directories to PYTHONPATH, and makes the genericUtils/macros executable from
any directory.) Now you can run these scripts in any directory:

    cd testarea
    SpuriousSignal.py ...

And that's it - you're ready to go!
